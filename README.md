# angularshoppinglist

A very small and simple shopping list app I made with Angular and Firebase. It is hosted on Firebase at <https://shoppinglistapp-43.web.app/>. I planned to user authentication so people could have their own list. But I learn enough with this project, left it, and moved on.

## Dependencies

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Hosting + Database (Cloud Firestore)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/): Framework
- [Nebula](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/): UI/UX

## If you want to run it locally

Make sure to add your firebase config to the [environements](src/environments) folder in [src](src). Just complete the two TODOs in the two files ([environment.ts](src/environments/environment.ts), [environment.prod.ts](src/environments/environment.prod.ts)).
